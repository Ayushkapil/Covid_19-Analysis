  <li>Verify that the data file, country_vaccinations.csv, is in the same directory as your Python script or notebook.</li>
  <li>Double-check the code for any typos or syntax errors.
  <li>If using Google Colab, ensure that you have a stable internet connection.</li>
  <li>If the code is running slowly or causing your computer to hang, consider running it on a more powerful machine or using cloud-based solutions.</li>
